# byteAddressable

The program should be run by running the TestMain.cpp file
It prompts you to enter the file name (along with the extension) that you want to run.
Make sure the file is in the same directory as the code
If the file is accessible the it starts to parse the code. If Not it terminates.
If the program is parsed without any errors then it prints the contents of the memory and registers after parsing
After Parsing it processes the binary code generated from the text code and outputs the final contents of memory and registers

Note:
The basic methodology of the design of the system, classes used and their functions is described in Methodology.txt
The type of Instructions and their encoding from text to binary is in Instructions.txt
A BubbleSort code is already written and updated in the above files this code sorts an array of 20 numbers this code 
The explanation of the code is in the comments, This code can be modified and tested for other values of intergers as well.
