Classes:
Register
Assembler along with error check 
Memory
Processor
ProcessorRegisters
Test class

========================================================================
Register:
	Function
It can set and return the values 
Can initialize all the registers 
Design-
An array of class Pair is used to store both value and isUsed 
======================================================================
Memory:
Attributes
An array of 16384 elements of type unsigned char
Methods
Get and set methods to get and set a single byte of the memory.
Get and set methods to get and set a 4-byte memory word.
A print method to print the user memory and the instruction memory ( here user memory is the memory used by the user to store and initialize values and instruction memory is the memory where the assembly code is decoded into binary code and stored in adjacent memory words ).  

========================================================================
ProcessorRegisters:
Attributes
It creates an object of Memory and Register classes
It contains all the 5 intermediate pipeline registers in the form of struct variables 
========================================================================
Processor:
Attributes
PC counter
Clock ( Counts the no of clock cycles taken to execute a program )
Methods
One method for each pipeline stage( IF , ID/RF , EX , MEM , WB ) which performs their respective job
One process method which processes the code clock cycle by clock cycle and provides the respective inputs to all the stages, and stores back the output of those processes for the next cycle.
========================================================================
Assembler:
	Function - 
To convert all the code into machine code 
To check for errors 
If not found Save the code in memory
If found stop the execution show the error

Design - 
Divided into 2 parts, the parser will first check all the code before the main tag And save all the data if provided in the user segment of the memory
If done the it will parse rest of the code
In first round it will check for errors and labels and save it all
If error found will stop and show the error
Else continue with the second round and save the code in memory

========================================================================
Test Main:
	It creates an object of Assembler and Processor and calls both the functions and prints the memory and registers values.
